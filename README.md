# Quantisation-of-Filter-Coefficients
This matlab code can be used for quantisation of filter coefficients (Digital Filter Design) 


This program is created for finite wordlength process for digital filter design.

This below program can be used to implement quantisation of filter coefficients using sign-magnitude method. Once can change code to use 2's complement to get required output.
